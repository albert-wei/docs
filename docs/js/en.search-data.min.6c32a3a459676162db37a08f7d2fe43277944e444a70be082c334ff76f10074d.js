This counter is not a cumulative counter; its updated at the end of every GC with count of the survivors during that particular GC only. This counter was designed to indicate the extra overhead that the application might incur because of finalization\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - Gen0heapsize\nMax bytes that can be allocated in generation 0 (Gen 0); its does not indicate the current number of bytes allocated in Gen 0. A Gen 0 GC is triggered when the allocations since the last GC exceed this size. The Gen 0 size is tuned by the Garbage Collector and can change during the execution of the application. At the end of a Gen 0 collection the size of the Gen 0 heap is infact 0 bytes; this counter displays the size (in bytes) of allocations that would trigger the next Gen 0 GC. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - Gen0PromotedBytesPerSec\nBytes per sec that are promoted from generation 0 (youngest) to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. This counter was designed as an indicator of relatively long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - Gen1heapsize\nCurrent number of bytes in generation 1 (Gen 1); this counter does not display the maximum size of Gen 1. Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from previous Gen 0 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - Gen1PromotedBytesPerSec\nBytes per sec that are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2 (oldest); objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. Nothing is promoted from generation 2 since it is the oldest. This counter was designed as an indicator of very long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - Gen2heapsize\nCurrent number of bytes in generation 2 (Gen 2). Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from Gen 1 during previous Gen 1 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - LargeObjectHeapsize\nCurrent size of the Large Object Heap in bytes. Objects greater than 20 KBytes are treated as large objects by the Garbage Collector and are directly allocated in a special heap; they are not promoted through the generations. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberBytesinallHeaps\nSum of four other counters; Gen 0 Heap Size; Gen 1 Heap Size; Gen 2 Heap Size and the Large Object Heap Size. This counter indicates the current memory allocated in bytes on the GC Heaps\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberGCHandles\nCurrent number of GC Handles in use. GCHandles are handles to resources external to the CLR and the managed environment. Handles occupy small amounts of memory in the GCHeap but potentially expensive unmanaged resources\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberGen0Collections\nNo. of times the generation 0 objects (youngest; most recently allocated) are garbage collected (Gen 0 GC) since the start of the application. Gen 0 GC occurs when the available memory in generation 0 is not sufficient to satisfy an allocation request. This counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 0 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 1 or Gen 2) GC occurs. Global counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberGen1Collections\nNo. of times the generation 1 objects are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 1 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 2) GC occurs. Global counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberGen2Collections\nNo. of times the generation 2 objects (older) are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 2 GC (also called full GC). Global counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberInducedGC\nPeak number of times a garbage collection was performed because of an explicit call to GC.Collect. Its a good practice to let the GC tune the frequency of its collections\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberofPinnedObjects\nNo. of pinned objects encountered in the last GC. This counter tracks the pinned objects only in the heaps that were garbage collected e.g. a Gen 0 GC would cause enumeration of pinned objects in the generation 0 heap only. A pinned object is one that the Garbage Collector cannot move in memory\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberofSinkBlocksinuse\nCurrent number of sync blocks in use. Sync blocks are per-object data structures allocated for storing synchronization information. Sync blocks hold weak references to managed objects and need to be scanned by the Garbage Collector. Sync blocks are not limited to storing synchronization information and can also store COM interop metadata. This counter was designed to indicate performance problems with heavy use of synchronization primitives\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberTotalcommittedBytes\nAmount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently committed by the Garbage Collector. (Committed memory is the physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging file)\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - NumberTotalreservedBytes\nAmount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently reserved by the Garbage Collector. (Reserved memory is the virtual memory space reserved for the application but no disk or main memory pages have been used.)\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - PercentTimeinGC (%)\n% of elapsed time that was spent in performing a garbage collection (GC) since the last GC cycle. This counter is usually an indicator of the work done by the Garbage Collector on behalf of the application to collect and compact memory. This counter is updated only at the end of every GC and the counter value reflects the last observed value; its not an average\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - PromotedFinalizationMemoryfromGen0\nBytes of memory that are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1 just because they are waiting to be finalized. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - PromotedFinalizationMemoryfromGen1\nBytes of memory that are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2 just because they are waiting to be finalized. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter. This counter is reset to 0 if the last GC was a Gen 0 GC only\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - PromotedMemoryfromGen0\nBytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter\n  Microsoft - .NET CLR Memory - PromotedMemoryfromGen1\nBytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter. This counter is reset to 0 if the last GC was a Gen 0 GC only\n    MS Exchange\n  SmtpSend\n  Microsoft - SmtpSend - AveragebytesPerconnection\n  Microsoft - SmtpSend - AveragemessagebytesPermessage\n  Microsoft -

The aggregate of flush counters for all virtual disks on both controllers is the rate at which data is written to the physical drives and is equal to the aggregate host write data. Data replication data written to the destination volume is included in the flush statistics. Host writes to Snapshot and Snapclone volumes are included in the flush statistics, but data flow for internal Snapshot and Snapclone normalization and copy-before-write activity is not included\n  HP - Virtual Disk - Mirror (MB/s)\nRate at which data moves across the mirror port in servicing read and write requests to a virtual disk. Write data is always copied through the mirror port when cache mirroring is enabled for redundancy. The mirror data rate includes read data from the owning controller that must be returned to the requesting host through the proxy controller. Reported mirror traffic is always outbound from the referenced controller to the other controller. If a write stream has been determined to be sequential access or if the virtual disk is Vraid 1 or 0, the mirror traffic for that stream includes only its write data. However, a random workload to a Vraid 5 volume requires parity to be copied as well, so the mirror data rate for that specific stream is double the host write data rate (one parity byte for every host data byte). Host writes to Snapshot and Snapclone volumes are mirrored and included in the mirror data rate statistics for the replication volumes. Snapclone normalization writes and copy-before-write activity for both Snapshot and Snapclones are done by the owning controller and do not pass through the mirror port. Mirror rates for the virtual disk on the destination system for a remote mirror pair includes initial copy and merge traffic to the replication volumes on the destination system as per normal host write operations\n  HP - Virtual Disk - Prefetch (MB/s)\nRate at which data is read from physical storage into cache in anticipation of subsequent reads when a sequential read stream is detected. HP Continuous Access EVA initial copy data traffic for a replicated virtual disk is reported by the owning controller in the source volume prefetch statistics\n    Wattage\n  HP - Wattage - reading (W)\n  HP -

Port receive statistics - BytesGood\nNo. of bytes transmitted by the port in good packets. The count includes the 4 CRC bytes but does not include the preamble or SFD bytes. A good packet is one that has been transmitted successfully (not aborted) with a good CRC. It is assumed that all transmit packets are properly sized, 64 bytes (after any padding) to maxsize bytes long\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - BytesTotal\nNo. of bytes transmitted by the port in good and bad packets. The count includes the 4 CRC bytes but does not include the preamble or SFD bytes. Bad packets include normal collisions, late collisions, and FIFO underflows. For collisions, all bytes transmitted before the start of the collision as well as the colliding and jam bytes are counted. For FIFO underflows, all bytes actually transmitted are counted\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - UnicastPkts\nGood unicast packets transmitted by this port. Good unicast packets are packets that are not dropped and have a good CRC. Unicast packets are identified by having a 0 in the least significant bit of the first byte of the destination address (i.e. the first bit transmitted is a 0)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - MulticastPkts\nGood multicast packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). Multicast packets are identified by having a 1 in the least significant bit of the first byte of the destination address (i.e. the first bit transmitted is a 1). Broadcast packets are not included in this count\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - BroadcastPkts\nGood broadcast packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). Broadcast packets are identified by a destination address of all 1\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - PauseFrames\nGood flow control pause packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). Flow control pause packets are identified by a type of 0x8808 and an opcode field of 0x0001\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - TaggedFrames\nGood VLAN packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). VLAN packets are identified by a type field equal to 0x8100 in the outer VLAN tag\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - CRCErrors\nTransmitted packets with a bad non-appended CRC field. This count doesn\u0026rsquo;t include any packets with a bad CRC due to a FIFO underflow\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Deferred\nNo. of packets that were deferred on the first transmit attempt due to the medium being busy. Packets with subsequent deferrals (for instance, after a collision back off) are not counted. Whether the packet is eventually transmitted successfully or not is irrelevant to this counter. Packets dropped due to excess deferral that occur during the initial transmit attempt are not counted\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - ExcessiveDeferrals\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to excessive deferral. The deferral time starts at the beginning of each transmission attempt and ends when the transmission starts (regardless of collisions). The deferral is excessive if more than 3036 byte times have passed without the transmission starting\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - SingleCollisions\nNo. of times a packet is successfully transmitted from this port after experiencing a single collision. This count does not include erroneous (dropped) packets\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - MultipleCollisions\nNo. of times a packet is successfully transmitted from this port after experiencing multiple collisions. This count does not include erroneous (dropped) packets and also does not include packets dropped due to excess collisions\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - ExcessiveCollisions\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to excess collisions (number of collisions equals MaxRetry+1). This count does not include packets dropped due to FIFO underflow or late collisions (even if the late collision is also an excessive collision)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - LateCollisions\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to late collisions. A late collision is a collision that occurs after the collision window time (normally 512-bit times). This count does not include packets dropped due to FIFO underflow. Late collisions are not retried\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - NormalCollisions\nNo. of normal collisions that have occurred on this port during all transmission attempts. FIFO underflows, late collisions and collisions that occur while this port is not trying to transmit are not counted. This count does not include collisions during half-duplex back pressure\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - FifoErrors\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to an underflow in the transmit FIFO. When an underflow is detected, transmission is immediately aborted after sending a known bad (inverted) CRC sequence. The FIFO underflow error takes precedence over all other errors if this counter is incremented, then none of the other packet type counters are incremented\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts64\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were exactly 64 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts65to127\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 65 to 127 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts128to255\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 128 to 255 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts256to511\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 256 to 511 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts512to1023\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 512 to 1023 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts1024to1518\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 1024 to 1518 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts1519to2047\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 1519 to 2047 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts2048to4095\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 2048 to 4095 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts4096to8191\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 4096 to 8191 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - Pkts8192andMore\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were greater than 8192 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port receive statistics - PktsLarge\nTotal no. of large packets transmitted by this port.

The count includes the 4 CRC bytes but does not include the preamble or SFD bytes. A good packet is one that has been transmitted successfully (not aborted) with a good CRC. It is assumed that all transmit packets are properly sized, 64 bytes (after any padding) to maxsize bytes long\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - BytesTotal\nNo. of bytes transmitted by the port in good and bad packets. The count includes the 4 CRC bytes but does not include the preamble or SFD bytes. Bad packets include normal collisions, late collisions, and FIFO underflows. For collisions, all bytes transmitted before the start of the collision as well as the colliding and jam bytes are counted. For FIFO underflows, all bytes actually transmitted are counted\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - UnicastPkts\nGood unicast packets transmitted by this port. Good unicast packets are packets that are not dropped and have a good CRC. Unicast packets are identified by having a 0 in the least significant bit of the first byte of the destination address (i.e. the first bit transmitted is a 0)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - MulticastPkts\nGood multicast packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). Multicast packets are identified by having a 1 in the least significant bit of the first byte of the destination address (i.e. the first bit transmitted is a 1). Broadcast packets are not included in this count\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - BroadcastPkts\nGood broadcast packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC). Broadcast packets are identified by a destination address of all 1\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - PauseFrames\nGood flow control pause packets transmitted by this port (good means not dropped and valid CRC).

This count doesn\u0026rsquo;t include any packets with a bad CRC due to a FIFO underflow\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Deferred\nNo. of packets that were deferred on the first transmit attempt due to the medium being busy. Packets with subsequent deferrals (for instance, after a collision back off) are not counted. Whether the packet is eventually transmitted successfully or not is irrelevant to this counter. Packets dropped due to excess deferral that occur during the initial transmit attempt are not counted\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - ExcessiveDeferrals\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to excessive deferral. The deferral time starts at the beginning of each transmission attempt and ends when the transmission starts (regardless of collisions). The deferral is excessive if more than 3036 byte times have passed without the transmission starting\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - SingleCollisions\nNo. of times a packet is successfully transmitted from this port after experiencing a single collision. This count does not include erroneous (dropped) packets\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - MultipleCollisions\nNo. of times a packet is successfully transmitted from this port after experiencing multiple collisions. This count does not include erroneous (dropped) packets and also does not include packets dropped due to excess collisions\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - ExcessiveCollisions\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to excess collisions (number of collisions equals MaxRetry+1). This count does not include packets dropped due to FIFO underflow or late collisions (even if the late collision is also an excessive collision)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - LateCollisions\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to late collisions. A late collision is a collision that occurs after the collision window time (normally 512-bit times). This count does not include packets dropped due to FIFO underflow. Late collisions are not retried\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - NormalCollisions\nNo. of normal collisions that have occurred on this port during all transmission attempts. FIFO underflows, late collisions and collisions that occur while this port is not trying to transmit are not counted. This count does not include collisions during half-duplex back pressure\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - FifoErrors\nNo. of packets dropped by this port due to an underflow in the transmit FIFO. When an underflow is detected, transmission is immediately aborted after sending a known bad (inverted) CRC sequence. The FIFO underflow error takes precedence over all other errors if this counter is incremented, then none of the other packet type counters are incremented\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts64\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were exactly 64 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts65to127\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 65 to 127 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts128to255\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 128 to 255 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts256to511\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 256 to 511 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts512to1023\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 512 to 1023 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts1024to1518\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 1024 to 1518 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts1519to2047\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 1519 to 2047 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts2048to4095\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 2048 to 4095 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts4096to8191\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were 4096 to 8191 bytes in length inclusive (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - Pkts8192andMore\nTotal no. of packets, good or bad, transmitted by this port that were greater than 8192 bytes in length (excluding preamble and SFD but including CRC)\n  Overture - Port transmit statistics - PktsLarge\nTotal no. of large packets transmitted by this port.
